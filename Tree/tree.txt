Here are some basic tree-based problems that will help you build a strong foundation:

### **1. Traversal Techniques**
- Implement in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal (recursive and iterative).
- Perform level-order traversal (using a queue).

### **2. Basic Operations**
- Insert a node into a binary search tree (BST).
- Delete a node from a BST.
- Find the height of a binary tree.
- Check if two binary trees are identical.

### **Tips for Practice**
1. Start with traversal techniques to understand tree navigation.
2. Move to implementing operations like insertion, deletion, and searching in BSTs.
3. Gradually take up LeetCode problems, starting with the "Easy" category.
4. Visualize the tree structure while solving problems to better understand recursion and traversal paths.
5. Use online tools like [Visualizer for Binary Trees](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html) for debugging and visualization.
