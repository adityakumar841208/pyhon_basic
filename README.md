# Python Basics - Learning Repository

Welcome to my Python Basics repository! This is a collection of simple Python projects and exercises that I've created to learn the fundamentals of Python programming.

## About

As a beginner in programming, I started this repository to practice key concepts like variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and file handling. Each file represents a small project or exercise that helped me get hands-on experience with Python.

### Whatâ€™s inside:

* Basic Python syntax and concepts
* Simple projects to demonstrate core programming techniques
* Code examples and explanations to help me (and others) learn

## Goal

My goal is to solidify my understanding of Python and eventually expand to more complex projects. I'm documenting my progress here, and I hope this repository can be helpful for others who are just starting out with Python too!
